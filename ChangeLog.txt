SAIL-ON Polycraft World Change Log:

Purpose: This document tracks changes and updates to Polycraft World that impact SAIL-ON Tasks, Evaluations, etc., including API changes.

2021.09.15 updates:
1)	(API Change) (Global) Position property format for entities was changed from a string to an integer array.
    a. Previously entity position reported as: "Pos":"BlockPos{x=5, y=4, z=20}"
    b. Now entity position reported as: "pos":[5,4,20]
    c. Reason for API Change: make position format consistent between entities and the player and other items. Previously, the player and other items were an integer array and entities were a string.
2)	(Bug fix) (Global) All entities are reported in SENSE commands as having the same position, even though they were in different locations. This has been fixed.
3)  (Bug fix) (Global) NOP command removed from commands that external actors ignore, which was causing NOP to not advance time for external actors.

2021.08.31 updates:
1)	(New Feature) (Global)  Color attribute for objects and actors added: Doors, keys, and patrols have a color attribute that is communicated in SENSE_ALL.
2)	(New Feature) (HUGA) Added command for training: Teleports the player anywhere facing any direction. There are no checks on this, you can teleport to any position, and it will always succeed. Including inside blocks.
    a.	Ex. TELEPORT [x] [y] [z] [yaw] [pitch] 
        i.	Yaw: Ranges from 0 to 270 where 0 is south, 90 is West, 180 is North, and 270 is East. 
        ii.	Pitch: Ranges from -90 to 90 where -90 is looking straight up, 0 is looking forward, and 90 is looking straight down.
    b.	This command is disabled by default. To enable this command, you must set the environment variable “PAL_DEV” to “true”.
3)	(Bug fix) (HUGA) Guide Dog blocking path fixed: The Guide Dog pathing was changed so that it will not block walkways.
4)	(New feature)(HUGA) Red Patrols removed from Room 1: Red Patrols no longer spawn in Room 1, so they will not be present near the player re-spawn point.
5)	(New feature)(HUGA) Red Patrols don’t pursue the TA2 Agent: Red Patrols no longer move purposefully towards the TA2 Agent in pre-novelty, they now move completely randomly with respect to the TA2 Agent.
6)	(New feature)(HUGA) Size of held objects increased: The size of held objects, such as the Armor held by Blue Patrols or Keys held in the Locksmith novelty has been increased so that they are clearly visible.
